  Finally, you enter the spirit's grove, and command it to reveal itself. The spirit obliges, and a lithe, flowing form materialises in front of you.
  
  The spirit states that it is the spirit of a nearby brook, and has been playing jokes on the nearby villagers to relieve the boredom of its small domain. Clearly, you cannot allow this to pass, but the spirit refuses to obey you and stop.

  text: Intimidate the spirit into obeying you
  test: Str + Pre vs. 5
  success: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: You quickly make the spirit understand that you are not to be trifled with. It agrees to stop its mischievous behaviour, and even gives you a small bribe to ensure you don't hurt it further.
    effect: Treasure
  failure: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: You threaten the spirit, but it just bursts out laughing. Suddenly, a jet of water ejects you from the grove and you land on your rear-end outside. Chastened and damp, you trudge home.
    effect: Nothing
- !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution
  text: Reason with the spirit
  test: Man + Soc vs. 4
  success: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: Patiently, you explain to the spirit why what it's doing is wrong. It takes a while, but eventually the spirit comes around to your way of thinking and it agrees to leave the village alone.
    effect: Nothing
  failure: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: You explain why the spirit's behaviour is unacceptable, but it just bursts out laughing. Suddenly, a jet of water ejects you from the grove and you land on your rear-end outside. Chastened and damp, you trudge home.
