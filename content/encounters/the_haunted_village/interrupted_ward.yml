notes: Replaces Entry Ward if Investigate succeeded.
text: |-
  You reach the Spirit's grove, but your way is checked when you detect a crude series of Essence-wards hastily and incompletely erected, no doubt, in anticipation of your arrival. Before you can confront the recalcitrant being, you must pass through them.

- !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution
  text: Try to deactivate the wards
  test: Int + Occ vs. 3
  success: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome 
    text: A few moments' study reveals the nature of these wards, and you are able to apply a few subtle pushes of Essence to render them harmless.
    effect: Nothing
  failure: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome 
    text: You tentatively channel a little Essence to disrupt the wards, and your caution proves valuable; a miscalculation causes a brief backlash as the wards disintegrate.
    effect: -1L
  botch: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome 
    text: Confident you know how to disrupt the wards, you channel some Essence into them. Sadly, your confidence was misplaced, and you suffer a violent backlash. At least the wards went too.

- !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution
  text: Push through the wards
  test: Sta + Res vs. 3
  success: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome 
    text: Bravely, you push hard against the wards. Essence arcs off your skin, but you shrug off the effects and enter the grove.
    effect: Nothing
  failure: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome 
    text: Bravely, you push hard against the wards. Essence arcs off your skin, causing minor burns as you enter the grove.
