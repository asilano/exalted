  text: Attack!
  test: Str + Mel/MA vs. 3
  success: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: The golem is a tough opponent, and manages to land a blow on you before you can fell it. On the plus side, you are able to take one of its former possessions for yourself.
    effect: -1L, treasure
  failure: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: Try as you might, you just cannot bring the golem down. After suffering a blow to the head, you decide to make a run for it. Thankfully, the guardian declines to follow.
    effect: -1L
- !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution
  text: Try to sneak past
  test: Dex + Ste vs. 5
  success: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: Staying as quiet as a mouse and finding what cover you can, you manage to sneak past the guardian without being spotted.
    effect: Nothing
  failure: !ruby/object:EncounterFile::Resolution::Outcome
    text: Just when you thought you were past, you stumble and alert the guardian to your presence. The pain from blow you suffer before you scramble away reinforces the strength of stone.
    effect: -2L
text: |-
  "_HALT!_" you hear. The voice can only come from a massive stone guardian which blocks your path.
  
  Relic of some long-dead Essence-wielder, it stands there impassively; yet you have no doubt it is ready to attack any who try to pass it.
